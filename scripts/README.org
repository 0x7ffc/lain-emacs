* Scripts

** bin

I /borrowed/ =ec= =et= and =es= from [[http://mjwall.com/blog/2013/10/04/how-i-use-emacs/][here]], highly recommended.

 - =ec= connect to emacsclient, start one if not already started (GUI).
 - =et= same as above, except in terminal.
 - =es= kill emacs server.

** zshrc

My personal =.zshrc= config, you probably don't need to use this.

#+begin_src shell
  ln -sf ~/.emacs.d/scripts/zshrc ~/.zshrc
#+end_src
